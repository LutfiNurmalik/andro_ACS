These include items administered or solid to patients by doctor or medical administrations.</p>\r\n<p>Consumer commodities may only include substances of Class 2 (non-toxic aerosols only), Class 3 (Packing Group II or III), Division 6.1 (Packing Group III only), UN 3077, UN 3082 and UN 3175, provided such substances do not have a subsidiary risk. Dangerous goods that are forbidden for transport aboard passenger aircraft must not be transported as consumer commodities.</p>\r\n<p>Other dangerous goods not classified as ID 8000 must not be packed in the same outer packaging with ID 8000.</p>\r\n<p>Except as otherwise provided below, dangerous goods packed in accordance with this packing instruction do not need to comply with Subsection 5.0, except 5.0.1.5 or Section 6 of these Regulations; they must, however, comply with all other applicable requirements:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>each packaging must be designed and constructed to prevent leakage that may be caused by changes in altitude and temperature during air transport;</li>\r\n<li>inner packagings that are breakable (such as earthenware, glass or brittle plastic) must be packed to prevent breakage and leakage under conditions normally incident to transport;</li>\r\n<li>each package offered for transport must be capable of withstanding a 1.2 m drop on solid concrete in the position most likely to cause damage. The criteria for passing the test is that the outer packaging must not exhibit any damage liable to affect safety during transport and there must be no leakage from the inner packaging(s). Each package offered for transport must be capable of withstanding, without breakage or leakage of any inner packaging and without significant reduction of effectiveness, a force applied to the top surface for a duration of 24 hours equivalent to the total weight of identical packages if stacked to a high of 3 m (including the test sample):</li>\r\n<li>when filling receptacles for liquids, sufficient ullage (outage) must be left to ensure that neither leakage nor permanent distortion of the receptacle will occur as a result of an expansion of the liquid caused by temperatures likely to prevail during transport. Unless specific requirements are prescribe in national rules or international agreements, liquids must not completely fill a receptacle at a temperature of 55<sup>o</sup> At this temperature a minimum ullage of 2% should be left. The primary packaging (which may include composite packaging), for which retention of the liquid is a basic function, must be capable of withstanding without leakage, an internal pressure which produces a pressure differential of not less than 75 kPa (0,75 bar) or a pressure related to the vapour pressure of the liquid to be conveyed, whichever is the greater. The pressure related to the vapour pressure must be determined by the method shown in 5.0.2.9. Tests on sample receptacles must be carried out to demonstrate the capability of the primary packing to withstand the above pressure;</li>\r\n<li>stoppers, corks or other such friction-type closures must be held securely, tightly and effectively in place by positive means. The closure device must be so designed that it is extremely improbable that it can be incorrectly or incompletely closed and must be such that it may be easily checked to determine that it is completely closed;</li>\r\n<li>inner packagings must be tightly packed in strong outer packagings and must be so packed, secured or cushioned as to prevent any breakage, puncture or leakage of the contents into the outer packaging(s) during normal conditions of transport. Absorbent material must be provided for glass or earthware inner packaging(s) containing consumer commodities in Class 3 or liquids of Division 6.1, in sufficient quantity to absorb the liquid contents of the largest of such inner packagings contained of the inner packagings. Notwithstanding the above, absorbent material may not be required if the inner packagings are so protected that breakage of the inner packagings and leakage of their contents from the outer packaging will not occur during normal conditions of transport;</li>\r\n<li>packagings (including closures) in direct contact with dangerous goods must be resistant to any chemical or other action of such goods. The materials of the receptacles must not content substances which may react dangerously with the contents, form hazardous products or significantly weaken the receptacles;</li>\r\n<li>each completed packaged as prepared for shipment must not exceed a gross weight of 30 kg;</li>\r\n<li>Class 2 substances must be further limited to aerosol products containing non-toxic compressed or liquefied gas(es) that are necessary to expel liquids, powders or pastes, packed in inner non-refillable non-metal receptacles not exceeding 120 mL capacity each, or in inner non-refillable metal receptacles not exceeding 820 mL capacity each (except that flammable aerosols must not exceed 500 mL capacity each), subject, in either case, to the following provisions:</li>\r\n<li>the pressure in the aerosol must not exceed 1,500 kPa at 55<sup>o</sup>C (15.0 bar) and each receptacle must be capable of withstanding without bursting a pressure of at least 1.5 times the equilibrium pressure of the contents at 55<sup>o</sup>C;</li>\r\n<li>if the pressure in the aerosol exceed 970 kPa at 55<sup>o</sup>C (9.7 bar) but does not exceed 1,105 kPa at 55<sup>o</sup>C (11.0 bar), a metal IP7, IP7A or IP7B must be used;</li>\r\n<li>if the pressure in the aerosol exceed 1,105 kPa at 55<sup>o</sup>C (11.05 bar) but does not exceed 1,245 kPa at 55<sup>o</sup>C (12.45 bar), a metal IP7, IP7A or IP7B must be used;</li>\r\n<li>if the pressure in the aerosol exceeds 1,245 kPa at 55<sup>o</sup>C (12.45 bar), a metal IP7B must be used;</li>\r\n<li>IP7B metal receptacles having a minimum burst pressure of 1,800 kPa may be equipped with inner capsule charge with a non-flammable, non-toxic compressed gas to provide the propellant function. In this case, the pressure indicated in 1, 2, 3 or 4 do not apply to the pressure within the capsule. The quantity of gas contained in the capsule must be so limited that the minimum burst pressure of the receptacle would not be exceeded if the entire gas content of the capsule were released into an aerosol;</li>\r\n<li>the liquid content must not completely fill the closed receptacle at 55<sup>o</sup>C;</li>\r\n<li>each aerosol exceeding 120 mL capacity must have been heated until the pressure in the aerosol is equivalent to the equilibrium pressure of the contents at 55<sup>o</sup>C without evidence of leakage, distortion or other defect;</li>\r\n<li>the valves must be protected by a cap or other suitable means during transport to prevent accidental activation.</li>\r\n<li>For aerosols containing a biological or medical preparation which will be deteriorated by a heat test and which are non-toxic and non-flammable, packed in inner non-refillable receptacles not exceeding 575 mL capacity each, the following provisions are applicable:</li>\r\n<li>the pressure in the aerosol must not exceed 970 kPa at 55<sup>o</sup>C (9.7 bar);</li>\r\n<li>the liquid contents must not completely fill the closed receptacle at 55<sup>o</sup>C;</li>\r\n<li>one aerosol out of each lot of 500 or less, must be heated until the pressure in the aerosol is equivalent to the equilibrium pressure of the contents at 55<sup>o</sup>C without evidence of leakage, distortion or other defect;</li>\r\n<li>the valves must be protected by a cap or other suitable means during transport to prevent accidental activation.</li>\r\n<li>Except for aerosols, inner packagings must not exceed:</li>\r\n<li>500 mL for liquids; and</li>\r\n<li>500 g for solids.</li>\r\n<li>Consumer commodities shipped according to these provisions may be shipped in a unit load device or other type of pallet when prepared by a single shipper provided they contain no other dangerous goods. The shipper must provide the operator with written documentation stating the number of packages and the total gross weight of ID 8000 contained in each unit load device;</li>\r\n<li>The gross weight on the Shipper&rsquo;s Declaration for Dangerous Goods must be shown as :</li>\r\n<li>for one package, the actual gross weight of the package;</li>\r\n<li>for more than one package, either the actual gross weight of each package or as the average weight of the package. For example, if there are 10 packages and the total gross weight of them is 100 kg, the shipper&rsquo;s Declaration for Dangerous Goods may show this is &ldquo;average gross weight per package 10 kgG&rsquo;.</li>\r\n<li>Packages prepared in accordance with these provisions must be durably and legibly marked with the mark shown in Figure 7.1.A.</li>\r\n</ol>'),
